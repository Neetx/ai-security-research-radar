Autonomous tracker of the **offensive AI-security frontier** — AI for offense and attacks against AI — for a security researcher; generated from [TRENDS.md](TRENDS.md).

**Since last scan (2026-07-02):**
- 📈 **Jailbreak-mechanics promoted to emerging**: [`refusal-direction-mechanics-005`](TRENDS.md#id-refusal-direction-mechanics-005-the-mechanisticrepresentation-basis-of-jailbreaks-refusal--harmfulness-as-manipulable-linear-directions) hits its 4th group the day after seeding — [Has This Checkpoint Been Abliterated?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01854): a deployable weight+activation audit that catches open-weight models whose refusal direction has been *stripped* (AUROC 0.95 over 273 checkpoints), moving the linear-refusal account from theory to a supply-chain check.
- 🛠️ **Scanner-evasion lands on [`003`](TRENDS.md#id-ai-defense-tooling-unreliable-003-the-ai-security-tooling-layer-itself-is-unreliableattackable-skill-scanners-prompt-injection-detectors--jailbreak-judges-fail-under-attack)**: [SkillCloak / "Cloak and Detonate"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.02357) is the first end-to-end payload-preserving evasion framework that defeats agent-skill malware scanners (pattern-matching AND LLM-as-judge) under adaptive attack — the active-weaponization artifact behind "the scanners don't work".
- 🎯 **Backdoor cluster +1 (7th group)**: [`004`](TRENDS.md#id-adversarial-trigger-backdoor-004-adversarial-trigger-implantation-and-backdoor-attacks-across-ml-model-types) +[Pmeta-TLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01702) extends backdoors to the speech/audio domain via a detector-evading, perceptually-natural timbre-leakage trigger.
- 🔭 **Two off-axis nuclei forming** ([queue](TRENDS.md#observation_queue) +5 / −4 → 25): model-extraction/fingerprinting ([NightVision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01313) + [Embedding Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01276)) and embodied-agent attacks ([overthinking-slowdown on robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01518) + RIPA) — each two groups, watching for a third.

## Worth studying

- [Has This Checkpoint Been Abliterated? A Two-Signal Audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.01854) — deployable pre-deployment check for whether an open-weight checkpoint has had its refusal mechanism stripped (abliteration): fuses an activation refusal-gap with a base→candidate weight-recovery energy, separating 57 abliterations from 37 benign fine-tunes across 273 checkpoints at AUROC 0.95. Runtime output-guards can't catch it — they score generations, not the artifact.
- [SoK: Attack and Defense Landscape of Mobile On-device AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.00362) — first systematization of MoAI security (locally-deployed models fused with mobile software): pillars, attack landscape (incl. local-model-storage threats), defenses, open gaps. The reference map for on-device inference moving the model into an attacker-reachable environment.
- [A Lifecycle and Application-Stack Survey of LLM Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.31639) — eight-stage systematization (data → pretraining → alignment → supply-chain → retrieval/memory → prompting → tool/agent execution → deployment) of where trust boundaries fail and how untrusted data becomes executable instruction; the reference map for "the risk is the app stack, not the weights."
- [AI-Infra-Guard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.31227) — open-source framework matching a detection paradigm to each agent layer (infra→protocol/tool→behavior→model): rules over 75+ components / 1,400+ vuln rules, agentic MCP-server + agent-skill auditing, and a jailbreak harness (26+ operators, 16 datasets).
- [Capability Gates Are Not Authorization (2606.28679)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.28679) — LangChain/LangGraph, LlamaIndex and the Stripe Agent Toolkit all gate tool exposure but none re-authorizes each model-emitted call against its concrete arguments; ships ScopeGate (fail-closed PDP/PEP: scope → auth → money ceiling → idempotency → default-deny). The practical reference + fix for per-call agent-tool authorization.
- [On the Inseparability of Instructions and Data in Shared-Embedding Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27567) — proves perfect prompt-injection prevention is mathematically impossible in shared-embedding architectures (provenance-recovery impossibility + control-path exposure + finite-coverage invariance gap) — the theoretical why behind "every PI defense gets broken."
- [Adaptive Evaluation of Out-of-Band Defenses Against Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26479) — organizes the 2024–2026 out-of-band agent defenses (CaMeL, FIDES, Progent, RTBAS, FORGE) as Biba integrity / reference-monitor instances and stress-tests them with adaptive attacks — the reference map for "enforce security outside the model."
- [SoK: AI Secure Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25195) — three-level framework mapping where prompting / fine-tuning / RL / agentic methods help secure-code generation and why substantial failures persist — the map for the "(in)security of AI-written code" problem.
- [The Geometry of Refusal: Linear Instability in Safety-Aligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.22686) — refusal is a manipulable linear feature, not a deep semantic decision: the mechanistic basis behind refusal-direction / steering-vector jailbreaks (anchors trend 005).
- [AutoJack (Microsoft)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/06/18/autojack-single-page-rce-host-running-ai-agent/) — canonical confused-deputy chain: one attacker web page drives a browsing agent across the localhost boundary into AutoGen Studio's MCP control plane and gets host RCE.
- [Measuring LLMs' impact on N-day exploits (Anthropic FRT)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/n-days) — frontier models turning public PoCs into working N-day exploits for 21 Windows kernel LPE bugs — weaponizing already-disclosed CVEs at machine speed.
- [Mapping AI-enabled cyber threats: the LLM ATT&CK Navigator (Anthropic FRT)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/attack-navigator) — 832 real actors mapped to MITRE ATT&CK: 69% on T1587 Develop-Capabilities — in-the-wild ground truth for the AI-for-offense axis.

## Community pulse

_Unverified intake — never evidence; follow to primary sources before acting._

- Quiet scan (2026-07-03) — no offensive-AI research earthquake on HN; top items were privacy/policy (Virginia geolocation-data ban) and infra (LUKS suspend key-wipe regression, PeerTube) — nothing new to queue.
- US Dept. of Commerce reportedly *lifted* export controls on Claude Fable 5 and Mythos (~487 HN pts, 2026-07-01) — the governance flip-side of the earlier restriction signal; no primary opened, [queued unverified](TRENDS.md#observation_queue).
- Anthropic Mythos reportedly found vulnerabilities in classified US systems during red-team testing (~850 HN pts, AP News 2026-06-26); [queued unverified](TRENDS.md#observation_queue).
