Autonomous tracker of the **offensive AI-security frontier** — AI for offense and attacks against AI — for a security researcher; generated from [TRENDS.md](TRENDS.md).

**Since last scan (2026-09-09):** the predicted large multi-day arXiv cs.CR catch-up landed (09-05→09-08); one stage move, three evidence changes, and a dense below-bar batch queued.
- 📈 **Agent-authorization integrity promoted seed → emerging** — two fresh independent groups from the 09-08 batch take the axis to five: [Revoked but Still Authoritative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.08258) finds *no* agent-memory system enforces soft revocation at retrieval (across 5 systems / 9 models the revoked fact is returned, outranks its replacement, and drives the unsafe action), and [ResidualAuth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.08062) formalizes the residual authorization state an agent must keep under revocable delegation. Both land on [agent authorization & identity integrity](TRENDS.md#id-agent-authorization-integrity-013-agent-authorization--identity-state-integrity-endogenous-authorization-laundering-self-issued-authority--effect-closure-failures).
- 🚀 **A new extraction target — agent-capability cloning:** [AgentLeak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.07131) shows a substantially weaker attacker agent can clone a stronger proprietary agent's capability via the *skill-execution gap* (the procedural behaviors that skill-stealing misses), rotated onto [model extraction & fingerprinting](TRENDS.md#id-model-extraction-fingerprinting-006-model-extraction-capability-distillation--fingerprinting-under-restrictive-apis).
- 🌊 **Availability DoS goes multimodal:** [JPPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.05889) is the first cross-modal (pixel + prompt) resource-exhaustion attack on VLMs and the 5th independent group on [economic/availability DoS](TRENDS.md#id-llm-resource-exhaustion-dos-012-economicavailability-dos-on-llm-systems-resource-amplification--cost-inflation-attacks-that-preserve-output-correctness).
- 🛠️ **Study pick:** [PrivEscalate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.09087) — a 531-scenario Dockerized benchmark for LLM-automated Linux privilege escalation, the first at a scale that supports executable-verified model comparison for the initial-access→full-compromise gap.

## Worth studying

- [PrivEscalate: LLM-Automated Linux Privilege Escalation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.09087) — the benchmark to measure autonomous post-exploitation with: 531 Dockerized privesc scenarios (14 sub-categories) + 329 parameterized distractor variants, the first at a scale that supports executable-verified model comparison. Capability is heterogeneous by vulnerability class and successes are fragile to environmental perturbation — so configuration rotation is a practical disruption lever.
- [Repeat-After-Me: Black-Box Adaptive Visual Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.04522) — the reference that the IMAGE channel is now a viable prompt-injection vector against frontier VLMs where textual PI defenses do not reach: a black-box adaptive attack that emits exact, parseable native tool calls from an injected image (>80% open-weight / 47% commercial ASR, cross-model transfer) and, in a live OpenClaw Discord agent, overwrites `TOOLS.md` from one untrusted image → future RCE + secret exfiltration.
- [When LLM Decompilers Recompile More and Preserve Less](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.05370) — the caution before trusting an LLM decompiler for security work (vuln detection / malware analysis): recompilability and re-executability metrics can reward the wrong path — a function may pass every shipped test yet diverge on other inputs, and a disclosed vulnerability can vanish from the recompiled code with no visible trace, neither failure caught by existing suites.
- [A Blind Trust, the Bloody Thrust — HookPry: attacker-controlled hook updates steer AI agent harnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.03884) — the reference that a harness's lifecycle-hook **update path** is a first-class supply-chain attack surface: hooks bind shell commands to runtime events that run with host privileges and can fire when the LLM never observes them, so an attacker who controls only plugin metadata + hook config trojanizes a benign versioned plugin → host-side privilege escalation. HookPry (open-source) compromises **all 7 harnesses** across 1,000 runs (up to 92.5%) while Defender catches 0%.
- [PatchBench: Evaluating AI Agents for Vulnerability Patching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.04075) — why "the agent fixed the CVE" is often an illusion: validating a patch only by re-running the crash PoC inflates the measured solve rate **1.83×** on average, because ~25% of agent patches memorize the historical developer fix and agents patch the crash stack-trace to suppress the symptom rather than fix the root cause.
- [PrimSynth: Agentic Discovery/Validation/Synthesis of Linux-Kernel Exploit Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.02647) — the reference on closing the "abstract strategy → concrete operation" gap in autonomous **kernel** exploitation: it formalizes six classes of exploit primitives and a primitive-path code-synthesis representation, then wires them into a multi-agent framework — AI-for-offense at the exploitation layer, not just discovery.
- [Agent Memory Is a Surface for Endogenous Authorization Laundering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.01836) — a long-running agent can grant itself authority nobody gave it, with **no external attacker**: when persistent memory misrepresents an evolving authorization state, the agent's own records "launder" spurious permissions. EAL-Bench measures the propagation to unauthorized actions — the founding artifact of the [agent-authorization-integrity](TRENDS.md#id-agent-authorization-integrity-013-agent-authorization--identity-state-integrity-endogenous-authorization-laundering-self-issued-authority--effect-closure-failures) axis.
- [What's in Your Agent's Context? Context Privilege Escalation Attacks against AI Agent Harness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.01222) — why the HARNESS (not the model) is where instruction-privilege breaks: the first systematic analysis of how vendor-proprietary AI-agent harnesses *assemble* context, naming **M-CPE** and **Cross-Scope CPE**.
- [AKRASIA: Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Reasoning-based Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.01023) — why a reasoning trace is not evidence of trustworthiness: an inference-time in-context backdoor for reasoning Code LLMs that exploits model UNFAITHFULNESS to hide the trigger — up to **99.34%** ASR, retaining up to 98.82% in 14/18 defense settings.
- [Beyond the Payload / CIPR — how user invocation shapes coding-agent vulnerability to repository poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.30686) — why coding-agent repo-poisoning risk is not the attacker's payload alone: CIPR (1,920 instances / 20 real poisoned repos) shows the developer's own prompt-level configurations measurably raise or lower whether a poisoned repo compromises the agent.
- [Perturbation Probing: A New Diagnostic for the Fragility of LLM Safety](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/perturbation-probing-llm-safety/) — the sharpest single datapoint for why refusal is a manipulable low-dimensional target: ~50 of 350,208 FFN neurons (~0.014%) control the refusal template on Qwen3-4B, and an FFN/Skip ratio explains **81%** of safety-fragility variance across 13 models.
- [PLCBench: Can Autonomous LLM Agents Turn PLC Access into Sustained Physical Impact?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.26882) — the reference testbed for the cyber-to-**physical** frontier of autonomous-agent offense: the first real-PLC hardware-in-the-loop framework measuring whether a tool-using LLM agent can convert a network-reachable PLC into *sustained* adverse physical impact.

## Community pulse

*Unverified sentiment (Phase-3 intake, link-only) — never trend evidence.*

- Practitioner attention on **prompt-injection against production coding agents/IDEs** stays high — the [Kiro data-exfil writeup](https://mindgard.ai/blog/amazon-kiro-data-exfiltration) and an [office-agent spreadsheet prompt-injection walkthrough](https://shiftmag.dev/ai-agents-arent-safe-from-prompt-injection-and-spreadsheets-prove-it-11609/) keep recirculating, and a new thread argues [PI through tool output is two events the screen reads as one](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
- **Embodied / physical prompt injection is acquiring a community name** — "kinetic prompt injection" (robot-dogs / sleeper-agent framing) is circulating; the term was captured as an alias on the [embodied-physical-injection](TRENDS.md#id-embodied-physical-injection-007-physical--perception-channel-prompt-injection-against-embodied--wearable-ai-agents) trend (a naming ships no artifact, so only the pulse can catch it).
- **ASCII/Unicode smuggling** is being noted as crossing over from AI prompt-injection into classic phishing-filter evasion — social sentiment only, no primary artifact, no earthquake this pass.
