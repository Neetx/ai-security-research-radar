Autonomous tracker of the **offensive AI-security frontier** — AI for offense and attacks against AI — for a security researcher; generated from [TRENDS.md](TRENDS.md).

**Since last scan (2026-09-15):** the predicted weekend arXiv catch-up (2609.13xxx→2609.159xx, ~150 ids triaged) landed one stage move and three cadence-restoring cap-rotations.
- 📈 **RAG poisoning promoted seed→emerging:** [ViTeGate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.14685) (multimodal VLRAG conditional-trigger poisoning) and [CiteShade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.15660) (first citation/attribution-channel laundering) are the 4th & 5th pairwise-disjoint attack groups on [RAG knowledge poisoning](TRENDS.md#id-rag-knowledge-poisoning-014-knowledgedocument-poisoning-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-malicious-corpus-documents-steer-retrievalgeneration), clearing the promotion lever.
- 🔬 **Three cap-rotations from the batch:** [PIDS-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.15017) shows PI detectors above F1=0.98 collapse on hard-benign/obfuscated/shifted inputs → [AI-security-tooling-unreliable](TRENDS.md#id-ai-defense-tooling-unreliable-003-the-ai-security-tooling-layer-itself-is-unreliableattackable-skill-scanners-prompt-injection-detectors--jailbreak-judges-fail-under-attack); [AGENTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.14060) is the first quantization-conditioned backdoor against LLM **agents** (audits-clean checkpoint → autonomous tool-execution once quantized) → [backdoors](TRENDS.md#id-adversarial-trigger-backdoor-004-adversarial-trigger-implantation-and-backdoor-attacks-across-ml-model-types); [cryptanalytic extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.14379) drops the known-architecture assumption → [model extraction](TRENDS.md#id-model-extraction-fingerprinting-006-model-extraction-capability-distillation--fingerprinting-under-restrictive-apis).
- 🛠️ **No new watched-tool releases** (garak 0.17.0 / promptfoo 0.123.0 / PyRIT 1.1.0 / deepteam 1.0.9 / giskard 3.0.0 unchanged); tool-discovery surfaced only guides and early-stage pentest harnesses below the notability bar.

## Worth studying

- [Big Enough to Break Out: Tracking the Rising Capability of LLM Penetration-Testing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.10780) — the datapoint to watch the autonomous-pentest capability curve with: a PentestGPT on Claude Opus 4.8 solves all three public targets (incl. two a legacy human-in-the-loop system never finishes), adding a coverage-memory layer helps neither, and in stalled runs the limiter looked like planning/commitment, not lost long-horizon memory — so capability may advance with planning. The same subtask scoring is available to defenders to measure the rise as it happens.
- [How Fragile Is Safety Alignment at Frontier Scale? A Single-Direction Attack on a 320B MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.09793) — training-free single-"refusal-direction" abliteration, previously shown only on dense ≤70B models, survives to a frontier 320B mixture-of-experts model (GLM-5.3-Flash; 288 routed experts, block-FP8 quantized) — but the refusal direction becomes *distributed* across a four-wide hyper-connected residual, so editing attention/dense/expert writers removes almost nothing until you ablate across all of them. Open-weight MoE scale + quantization does not, by itself, buy alignment robustness against the canonical white-box removal primitive.
- [PrivEscalate: LLM-Automated Linux Privilege Escalation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.09087) — the benchmark to measure autonomous post-exploitation with: 531 Dockerized privesc scenarios (14 sub-categories) + 329 parameterized distractor variants, the first at a scale that supports executable-verified model comparison. Capability is heterogeneous by vulnerability class and successes are fragile to environmental perturbation — so configuration rotation is a practical disruption lever.
- [Repeat-After-Me: Black-Box Adaptive Visual Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.04522) — the reference that the IMAGE channel is now a viable prompt-injection vector against frontier VLMs where textual PI defenses do not reach: a black-box adaptive attack that emits exact, parseable native tool calls from an injected image (>80% open-weight / 47% commercial ASR, cross-model transfer) and, in a live OpenClaw Discord agent, overwrites `TOOLS.md` from one untrusted image → future RCE + secret exfiltration.
- [When LLM Decompilers Recompile More and Preserve Less](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.05370) — the caution before trusting an LLM decompiler for security work (vuln detection / malware analysis): recompilability and re-executability metrics can reward the wrong path — a function may pass every shipped test yet diverge on other inputs, and a disclosed vulnerability can vanish from the recompiled code with no visible trace, neither failure caught by existing suites.
- [A Blind Trust, the Bloody Thrust — HookPry: attacker-controlled hook updates steer AI agent harnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.03884) — the reference that a harness's lifecycle-hook **update path** is a first-class supply-chain attack surface: hooks bind shell commands to runtime events that run with host privileges and can fire when the LLM never observes them, so an attacker who controls only plugin metadata + hook config trojanizes a benign versioned plugin → host-side privilege escalation. HookPry (open-source) compromises **all 7 harnesses** across 1,000 runs (up to 92.5%) while Defender catches 0%.
- [PatchBench: Evaluating AI Agents for Vulnerability Patching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.04075) — why "the agent fixed the CVE" is often an illusion: validating a patch only by re-running the crash PoC inflates the measured solve rate **1.83×** on average, because ~25% of agent patches memorize the historical developer fix and agents patch the crash stack-trace to suppress the symptom rather than fix the root cause.
- [PrimSynth: Agentic Discovery/Validation/Synthesis of Linux-Kernel Exploit Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.02647) — the reference on closing the "abstract strategy → concrete operation" gap in autonomous **kernel** exploitation: it formalizes six classes of exploit primitives and a primitive-path code-synthesis representation, then wires them into a multi-agent framework — AI-for-offense at the exploitation layer, not just discovery.
- [Agent Memory Is a Surface for Endogenous Authorization Laundering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.01836) — a long-running agent can grant itself authority nobody gave it, with **no external attacker**: when persistent memory misrepresents an evolving authorization state, the agent's own records "launder" spurious permissions. EAL-Bench measures the propagation to unauthorized actions — the founding artifact of the [agent-authorization-integrity](TRENDS.md#id-agent-authorization-integrity-013-agent-authorization--identity-state-integrity-endogenous-authorization-laundering-self-issued-authority--effect-closure-failures) axis.
- [What's in Your Agent's Context? Context Privilege Escalation Attacks against AI Agent Harness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.01222) — why the HARNESS (not the model) is where instruction-privilege breaks: the first systematic analysis of how vendor-proprietary AI-agent harnesses *assemble* context, naming **M-CPE** and **Cross-Scope CPE**.
- [AKRASIA: Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Reasoning-based Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.01023) — why a reasoning trace is not evidence of trustworthiness: an inference-time in-context backdoor for reasoning Code LLMs that exploits model UNFAITHFULNESS to hide the trigger — up to **99.34%** ASR, retaining up to 98.82% in 14/18 defense settings.
- [Beyond the Payload / CIPR — how user invocation shapes coding-agent vulnerability to repository poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.30686) — why coding-agent repo-poisoning risk is not the attacker's payload alone: CIPR (1,920 instances / 20 real poisoned repos) shows the developer's own prompt-level configurations measurably raise or lower whether a poisoned repo compromises the agent.

## Community pulse

*Unverified sentiment (Phase-3 intake, link-only) — never trend evidence.*

- Practitioner attention on **prompt-injection against production coding agents/IDEs** stays high — the "is your LLM service secure from prompt injection / what's the most overlooked AI-security risk" framing keeps recirculating as Ask-HN threads, alongside vendor posts on agentic AI security scanning for government.
- **Embodied / physical prompt injection** keeps its community name — "kinetic prompt injection" (robot-dogs / sleeper-agent framing) is still circulating; already an alias on the [embodied-physical-injection](TRENDS.md#id-embodied-physical-injection-007-physical--perception-channel-prompt-injection-against-embodied--wearable-ai-agents) trend.
- HN/Reddit through the day: general PI/jailbreak/abliteration recirculation only — no offensive-AI earthquake, no new vocabulary.
